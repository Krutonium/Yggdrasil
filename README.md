# Yggdrasil
Simple Library for Authenticating against Mojang's Login server (Called Yggdrasil) in .Net

It's been a while since I worked on this, so I am not sure if it is actually complete, but it is at least capable of logging in and providing the correct tokens with which you can start minecraft and connect to a premium server.
